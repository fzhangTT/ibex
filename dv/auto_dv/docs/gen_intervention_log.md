# Intervention log (Zone A team)

Append-only record of every owner question and answer, every restart, every fence event, and
every manual repair a human made to generated work (humans append their own entries). Entry
header: `## <ID> - <YYYY-MM-DD> - <LAUNCH|QUESTION|ANSWER|RESTART|FENCE|REPAIR|NOTE>`. IDs are
`LOG-nnn` for team entries, `Q-nnn` for owner questions (the answer is appended under the same
question), `H-nnn` for human repairs.

## LOG-001 - 2026-09-03 - LAUNCH

Launch-precondition check (`DV_prompt.txt` Section 12, items 1-11) PASS at export commit
`1908ddd`. Script: `dv/auto_dv/tools/gen_launch_check.sh`. Evidence:
`dv/auto_dv/evidence/gen_launch_check_2026-09-03.log`. The first run of the script reported
items 9 and 11 FAIL; cause was locale-dependent `sort` inside the script's set comparison, not a
clone defect. Fixed (`LC_ALL=C`), re-run, all items PASS. Team startup sequence step 1 begins.

Tooling inventory at launch (for the record): codex-cli 0.152.1 (cross-model reviewer), Claude
Code 2.1.259 (this session), VCS X-2025.06-SP2 + Verdi, LSF (`bsub` available, `regress` queue),
Python 3.12.10 venv present with cocotb, lowRISC rv32imcb GCC present. No Spike in the clone or
on PATH: the team builds upstream `riscv/riscv-isa-sim` under `<clone>/tools/` per
`SIM_RECIPE.md` Section 11 (`tools/` is excluded locally through `.git/info/exclude`).

## Q-001 - 2026-09-03 - QUESTION (to owner)

File-naming conflict between fence and team prompt. `docs/dv/FENCE.md` (Updates and landing)
says every new file under `dv/auto_dv/**` uses the `gen_` prefix, exempting only
`dv/auto_dv/.gitignore` and `dv/auto_dv/contract/**`. `agent_team_prompt.txt` names
`dv/auto_dv/docs/intervention_log.md` and `dv/auto_dv/docs/dashboard_metrics.md` without the
prefix, and the fence-provided cross-review wrapper writes `dv/auto_dv/reviews/<date>-codex-<name>.md`
without it. Applying "FENCE.md wins": every file the team creates carries the `gen_` prefix
(this log is `gen_intervention_log.md`); review-wrapper artifacts keep the wrapper's own naming
because the team does not edit fence-provided tooling. Please confirm this reading, or state that
the landing check exempts `docs/` and `reviews/`. Status: pending; no work depends on the answer.

## LOG-002 - 2026-09-03 - NOTE

`IBEX_TOOLS_DIR` (`/localdev/fzhang/ws/tools`) contains `spike-ibex-cosim/` and `src/`. The
first is the lowRISC Spike fork, which `DV_prompt.txt` Section 3 fences. Every teammate spawn
prompt names both paths as do-not-read. `ci/env.sh` does not reference either.

## LOG-003 - 2026-09-03 - NOTE (reviewer availability)

Probe of the preferred cross-model reviewer failed: `codex exec` (codex-cli 0.152.1, model
gpt-5.6-sol, reasoning high) returns "ERROR: You hit your spend cap set by the owner of your
workspace." before answering. Per CLAUDE.md (Cross-model review policy, reviewer preference)
and the cross-review skill's fallback clause, reviews use a fresh Opus-class-or-above Claude
session until codex is available again; every artifact header records the model used and the
raw codex error. Owner action that would restore the preferred path: raise the codex spend cap.
The Orchestrator re-probes codex before each review and switches back when it answers.

## A-001 - 2026-09-03 - ANSWER (owner ruling on LOG-003, relayed verbatim)

Owner (Forrest Zhang), in the Orchestrator session, 2026-09-03: "Note, if codex is still
unavailable, use a fable reviewer". Applied: while codex reports the spend cap, cross-model
reviews run in a fresh `claude -p --model fable` session (Claude Fable 5.1, the same model
family as the executing session but a separate session with no shared context). Each artifact
header records the CLI version, the model the run reports, and the codex error that triggered
the fallback. The Orchestrator re-probes codex before every review.
